# Visualizations

This folder contains all the generated plots and charts from the Urban Air Quality Analysis.

## Generated Files

When you run the Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/urban_air_quality_analysis.ipynb`), the following visualizations will be automatically saved here:

1. **missing_values.png** - Missing values analysis
2. **pollutant_distributions.png** - Distribution of all pollutants
3. **city_wise_comparison.png** - City-wise air quality comparison
4. **monthly_aqi_trend.png** - Monthly AQI trends over time
5. **top_cities_aqi_trend.png** - Trends for most polluted cities
6. **seasonal_analysis.png** - Seasonal pollution patterns
7. **seasonal_city_heatmap.png** - City-wise seasonal heatmap
8. **weekday_analysis.png** - Weekday vs weekend patterns
9. **correlation_matrix.png** - Pollutant correlation matrix
10. **scatter_plots.png** - Relationship between pollutants
11. **yearly_comparison.png** - Year-over-year comparison
12. **aqi_categories.png** - AQI category distribution
13. **city_aqi_categories.png** - AQI categories by city
14. **state_wise_aqi.png** - State-wise air quality comparison

## Usage

These visualizations are automatically generated when you run all cells in the Jupyter notebook. They are saved in high resolution (300 DPI) and can be used for:

- Research papers
- Presentations
- Reports
- Policy documents
- Educational materials

## Note

The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude PNG files from version control to keep the repository size small. You can modify this if you want to commit the visualizations.
